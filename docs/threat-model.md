# Threat model for _peer-play_ - a p2p video sharing platform

_Report done by [Nemanja Dutina](https://github.com/eXtremeNemanja/) and [Milica SladakoviÄ‡](https://github.com/coma007/)._   



This document provides threat modeling overview for a peer-to-peer video sharing platform that uses blockchain technology to secure video ownership, transactions, and user interactions. The platform has decentralized storage, smart contracts, and relational databases.

## Platform architecture

The platform architecture consists of the following components:

- **Relational database** - stores user credentials and video metadata, including ownership and [content identifiers (_CID_)](https://filebase.com/blog/what-is-an-ipfs-cid/) for locating videos in the peer-to-peer network.
- **Peer-to-peer network** - [_IPFS_ (InterPlanetary File System)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/) stores and retrieves video content, with [_libp2p_ protocol](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/protocols/) used for peer-to-peer communication.
- **Blockchain network** - local _Ethereum_ blockchain in [_HardHat_ environment](https://hardhat.org/docs) that uses [_JSON-RPC_ protocol](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) and secures ownership integrity and payment processing using smart contracts.
- **Server Application** - acts as a mediator between the database, blockchain, and peer-to-peer systems - keeps all the business logic in one place.
- **Client Application** - interface for users to upload, purchase, and play videos, with authentication and interaction modules.

The image bellow shows simple overview of the platform architecture.

This threat model will examine potential security risks associated with the use of technologies such as [_Node.js_](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/), [_React_](https://react.dev/reference/react), [_Hardhat_](https://hardhat.org/docs), and [_PostgreSQL_](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Main_Page), as well as the protocols like [_libp2p_](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/protocols/) and [_JSON-RPC_](https://www.jsonrpc.org/), focusing on blockchain, IPFS integration, user authentication, and server-client interactions.

## Platform data flows

The analyzed platform is a decentralized peer-to-peer video sharing system that offers the following functionalities:

- _Video Upload_: Users can upload their videos to the platform.
- _Video Purchase_: Users can securely purchase videos using integrated payment methods.
- _Video Playback_: Videos can be streamed directly on the platform without downloading.


To support these functionalities, the platform relies on three primary resources:

- _User Data_: Information related to user accounts.
- _Videos and Metadata_: Uploaded video content along with descriptive and transactional data.
- _Smart Contracts_: Blockchain-based contracts enabling secure and automated transactions.

The communication methods between platform components and the flow of data are outlined below:

1. User Application to Server Application

    - **Protocol**: _HTTP_
    - **Resources**: 
        - User requests (login, video uploads, purchases or playback)
    - **Actions**:
        - Authentication data is sent to the server for verification.
        - Video files are uploaded to be processed and stored in IPFS.
        - Purchase requests triggers smart contract execution on the Ethereum network.

2. Server Application to Relational Database (PostgreSQL)

    - **Protocol**: _HTTP_
    - **Resources**:
        - Usernames and hashed passwords
        - Video metadata (title, description, CID, ownership info)
    - **Actions**:
        - User authentication is validated against stored credentials.
        - Video metadata is stored or retrieved as needed.

3. Server Application to Peer-to-Peer Network (IPFS)

    - **Protocol**: _libp2p_
    - **Resources**: 
        - Video content when uploading
        - CID (Content Identifier) when retrieve stored videos
    - **Actions**:
        - Upload videos to IPFS, returning the CID.
        - Retrieve videos based on the provided CID.

4. Server Application to Blockchain Network (Ethereum)

    - **Protocol**: _JSON-RPC_
    - **Resources**:
        - Smart contract execution enforcing ownership,secure payments and access rights
    - **Actions**:
        - Register video ownership using a smart contract.
        - Process payments for video purchases.
